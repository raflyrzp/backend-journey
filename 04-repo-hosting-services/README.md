# ☁️ Repository Hosting Services

A **repository hosting service** is an online platform that stores and manages your Git repositories in the cloud, making collaboration, version tracking, and deployment easier than ever.

## 📖 What Is a Repository Hosting Service?

Rather than keeping your code only on your local machine, you push it to a remote service where you—and your team—can:

- **Backup code** securely
- **Collaborate** via pull/merge requests
- **Review** and comment on changes
- **Track issues** and feature requests
- **Automate** builds, tests, and deployments

## 🚀 Basic Workflow

1. **Create an account** on your chosen service.
2. **Create a new repository** (public or private).
3. On your local machine:
   ```bash
   git init
   git remote add origin <remote‑URL>
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin main
   ```
4. Invite collaborators or open it to the community.
5. Use issues, projects, and pull/merge requests to manage work.
6. Automate tests and deployments with built‑in CI/CD tools.

## 🔒 Public vs Private

- Public repos: Visible to anyone—ideal for open‑source and portfolios.
- Private repos: Restricted to invited collaborators—best for proprietary or early‑stage projects.

- Collaboration: Real‑time code reviews and discussion.
- Automation: Pipelines for testing, linting, and deployment.
- Discoverability: Showcase your work to recruiters and peers.
