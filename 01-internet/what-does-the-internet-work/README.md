## ⚙️ How Does the Internet Work?

Let’s say you want to visit `google.com`. Here’s what happens behind the scenes:

### 1. **You type `google.com` in your browser**

- Your browser acts as the client, sending a request to the server.

### 2. **DNS Lookup**

- The browser asks the DNS: "What’s the IP address of `google.com`?"
- DNS replies with something like `142.250.200.46`.

### 3. **Sending the Request**

- Your browser sends a request to that IP:  
  “Hey Google server, please send me the homepage.”

### 4. **Server Response**

- The server sends back HTML, CSS, JavaScript files.

### 5. **Rendering the Page**

- Your browser puts all the pieces together and displays the website to you.

This whole process usually takes **a fraction of a second**!

## 🛰 Internet Components Involved

| Component                          | Role                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 🖥 Client (Computer/Phone)          | Sends the request and receives the response     |

## 📦 Analogy: Sending a Package

Think of visiting a website like sending a package:

1. You write an address on the box (the domain name).
2. The postal system (DNS) finds the correct delivery route (IP address).
3. The package is transported (via the Internet protocol).
4. The receiver (server) accepts it and sends something back.

## 💡 Conclusion

The Internet isn't a single device or machine—it's a **network of millions of devices** working together using rules (protocols) to send, receive, and display information.

Whenever you browse a page, stream music, or send a chat, you’re using this vast, invisible network!
