# ☁️ What is Hosting?

When you've built a website or a backend application, the next step is to make it accessible to the world. This is where **hosting** comes in.

## 📖 Definition: What is Hosting?

**Hosting** is a service that allows your website, files, or backend applications to be stored on a **server** and accessed over the **Internet**.

In simple terms, hosting is **"renting space on a server"** so other people can visit your project using a domain or IP address.

## 🧠 Why is Hosting Important?

Without hosting, your project only exists **locally** on your computer. No one else can access it.

By hosting it:

- Your backend APIs can serve data to clients (apps, frontends, etc.)
- Your website can be seen by users globally
- You enable live deployment, making your project usable in real life

## 🏗️ How Hosting Works (Simplified)

1. You upload your project (code, files, database) to a **hosting provider**.
2. The provider stores your project on a **server** that is always online.
3. The server is connected to the Internet with a public **IP address**.
4. When someone accesses your domain or IP, the server **responds with your app or website**.

## 📦 Types of Hosting

| Type                             | Description                                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shared Hosting**               | Your project shares one server with others. Cheap but limited.                           |
| **VPS (Virtual Private Server)** | A virtual machine with more control and power.                                           |
| **Dedicated Hosting**            | You rent the whole physical server. Expensive and powerful.                              |
| **Cloud Hosting**                | Flexible and scalable. Uses multiple servers (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).                    |
| **Serverless Hosting**           | You deploy functions or apps without managing servers (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Firebase). |
