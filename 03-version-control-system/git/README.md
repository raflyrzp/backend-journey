## üìñ What is Git?

**Git** is a **distributed version control system** that allows you to keep a complete history of your project and manage your source code efficiently.

- ‚úÖ Distributed: Every developer has a full copy of the project history.
- ‚úÖ Local-first: You can commit and manage versions without Internet access.
- ‚úÖ Fast: Git is optimized for performance.

Whether you're working solo or in a team, Git ensures you can:

- Go back to previous versions
- Work on multiple features at once
- Collaborate without breaking each other's code
