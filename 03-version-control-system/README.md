# 🗂️ Version Control System (VCS)

A **Version Control System** (VCS) is a tool that helps developers **track changes**, **collaborate**, and **manage source code history** over time. It's a crucial part of modern software development workflows.

## 📖 What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

Instead of saving multiple copies like `project-v1`, `project-final`, and `project-final-final`, a VCS helps you manage all those versions cleanly and efficiently.

## 🧠 Why Use Version Control?

| Benefit                    | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Track history           | See what changed, who changed it, and when                                |
| ✅ Revert mistakes         | Restore previous versions or undo errors easily                           |
| ✅ Collaborate effectively | Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting code |
| ✅ Experiment safely       | Create branches to try new ideas without breaking the main code           |
| ✅ Merge changes           | Combine work from different branches or team members                      |

## 🛠️ Types of Version Control

| Type                       | Description                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local VCS**              | All changes are tracked on your machine only                                                 |
| **Centralized VCS (CVCS)** | Uses a central server (e.g., SVN). Needs constant connection and has single point of failure |
| **Distributed VCS (DVCS)** | Each developer has a full copy of the repo (e.g., Git, Mercurial). Can work offline          |

> ✅ **Git** is the most popular DVCS used today, and powers platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

## 🔄 How VCS Works (Simplified)

1. **Initialize** the version control system in your project folder.
2. **Add changes** to be tracked (staging).
3. **Commit** the changes with a message (snapshot).
4. **Review history**, **revert**, or **merge** as needed.
5. Optionally **push** to a remote server (like GitHub).

## 💡 Key Concepts

| Term           | Description                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Repository** | A folder tracked by version control           |
| **Commit**     | A snapshot of your project at a point in time |
| **Branch**     | A separate line of development                |
| **Merge**      | Combine branches or commits                   |
| **Push**       | Send local commits to remote repository       |
| **Pull**       | Get latest changes from remote repository     |

## 🧠 Summary

- A **Version Control System** helps developers track code changes over time.
- It supports collaboration, rollback, branching, and safe experimentation.
- Most modern projects use **Git**, a distributed version control system, alongside hosting platforms like GitHub.
