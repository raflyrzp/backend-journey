# 🧠 Redis — In-Memory Data Store

**Redis (REmote DIctionary Server)** is an open-source, lightning-fast, in-memory key-value store.  
It is commonly used for **caching**, **session storage**, **rate limiting**, **real-time data**, and **pub/sub messaging** in backend systems.

# 🚀 Why Use Redis?

| Feature             | Description                                                            |
