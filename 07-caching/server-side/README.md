# 🖥️ Server-Side Caching

**Server-side caching** refers to the practice of storing processed or frequently requested data **on the server**, so it can be quickly returned to clients without repeatedly querying the database or recalculating results.

This approach significantly improves **response time**, reduces **database load**, and increases **scalability**.
