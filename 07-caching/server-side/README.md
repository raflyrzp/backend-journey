# 🖥️ Server-Side Caching

**Server-side caching** refers to the practice of storing processed or frequently requested data **on the server**, so it can be quickly returned to clients without repeatedly querying the database or recalculating results.

This approach significantly improves **response time**, reduces **database load**, and increases **scalability**.

## 🧠 Why Server-Side Caching?

Without caching, every client request must be computed or queried from scratch, which is slow and resource-heavy.

With server-side caching:

- Frequently accessed data is **stored temporarily in memory or storage**.
- Future requests can **reuse the cached result**, avoiding redundant operations.
