# âš¡ Caching in Backend Systems

Caching is the process of **storing frequently accessed data in temporary storage** (called a cache) to make future data retrieval faster and reduce load on the primary database.

## ðŸ§  How Caching Works

1. **Client Requests Data**
2. **Application checks the cache**
   - If the data is found (**cache hit**), it returns immediately.
   - If not found (**cache miss**), the app queries the database.
3. **If cache miss**, data is fetched from the database, returned to the client, and **stored in the cache** for next time.
