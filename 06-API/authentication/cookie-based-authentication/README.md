# üç™ Cookie-Based Authentication

**Cookie-Based Authentication** is a traditional and widely-used method to manage user sessions.  
After the user logs in, the server creates a **session** and sends back a **cookie** that uniquely identifies the session. This cookie is automatically included in future requests by the browser.

## üß† How It Works

1. **User Logs In**  
   Client sends login credentials to the server (e.g., `POST /login`).

2. **Server Creates Session**  
   If credentials are valid, the server:

   - Creates a session (usually in memory or a database)
   - Stores session data (e.g., user ID, roles)
   - Generates a unique session ID

3. **Server Sends Cookie**  
   The session ID is sent to the client inside a `Set-Cookie` header.

   ```http
   Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict
   ```

4. **Browser Stores Cookie**
   The browser automatically stores the cookie.

5. **Client Makes Authenticated Requests**
   For every future request, the browser automatically includes the cookie:
   ```http
   Cookie: sessionId=abc123
   ```
6. **Server Validates Session**
   The server finds the session using the session ID and checks if it‚Äôs valid.
